# MetaNames 📛
MetaNames is a system for user naming similar to [Discord](https://discord.com/). It uses Solidity as the language and works on ethereum based blockchains. The four main differences from the [Ethereum Name Service] are:
- MetaNames never expire.
- MetaNames aren't NFTs (you can't transfer them).
- MetaNames (and every action you do with them) are totally free except gas.
- More than one person can have the same name, the difference will be the tag, that can go from 1 to 9999.

It isn't deployed on any blockchain at the moment, as I don't have money to cover the gas on ETH, and I don't think the project would be nice on another blockchain like Polygon without a project to use it. If you want, feel free to use it and deploy it anywhere, just say it was made by me and link this GitHub page.
